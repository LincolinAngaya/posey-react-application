# Module 4 Code Challenge: Poesy

Welcome to Poesy, where your poetry masterpieces come to life! Our old front-end team laid down the foundations for our app, but it looks like they forgot all the functionality! Yikes!

Your job will be to make our app work according to the following specifications.

## Setup instructions

When you run `npm start` a json server will spin up and you can access the poem info at `http://localhost:3000/poems`, _and_ your react application will also start, on port 3001.

## Deliverables

1. Display poems from the database

Make a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/poems` to fetch poem data. Use this data to render `Poem` components in the `PoemsContainer`!

2. Show / hide the `NewPoemForm`

Hook up the button in the sidebar to toggle the visibility of the `NewPoemForm`.

3. Create poems

When a user submit's a poem from the `NewPoemForm`, it should be posted to the API and it should be added to the list of poems on the right.

4. Mark poems as read

When a poem's `Read` button is clicked, it should be marked as read. You can use the `color` CSS value which has been provided to you in the `Poem` component to change the text color. Clicking it again should change it back to unread (colored black). _This does not need to be persisted in the database._

## Bonus Deliverables

Please only attempt these if you have finished all the other deliverables and have spare time! You may want to commit your code at this point.

5. Favorite poems

Add a second `PoemsContainer` component that will be used to display favorites. Add a "Like" button to each `Poem` component. When clicked, that poem will be added to a list of favorites and be displayed in the second `PoemContainer`.

6. Delete poems

Add a button to the `Poem` component which will remove a poem from the page _and_ delete it from the backend.
